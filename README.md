# US Flight Data Analysis

## Dependencies:
All of the code is embedded in the ipython/Jupyter notebook. This was installed with Anaconda 3.5.2 for **Python 3.5**.
`Seaborn` was used for the visualisations in combination with `matplotlib`. `numpy`, `scikit` are required as well.
For the machine learning part, `sklearn` was utilized.

Commands after installing Anaconda:
```bash
$ conda update conda
$ conda update ipython
$ conda install seaborn
```
The dependencies / jupyter can also be installed through the usual channels (`pip`)

A pre-rendered report is already available in HTML as well.

## Running
The notebook can be opened by typing:
```bash
$ ipython notebook
``` 
in the folder where the project was extracted.
